# Discord Market and our new Dapp "Niwa" will be launched
After the overwhelming positivity around the latest governance proposal, Dev Protocol is pleased to announce that the Discord market will be launched at the end of this month. With this new and latest addition, the Discord market will be considered the 3rd largest market that Dev Protocol expands to, following the prior incorporation of both the Github and YouTube markets alike. The Discord market will be deployed on Arbitrum as well as Polygon, allowing users to socially tokenize their Discord guilds (i.e. servers) and build powerful communities. You’re welcome.

Furthermore, our new Dapp "Niwa" will be released at the same time.
Niwa is a Dapp specially made to be used by creators by letting them mint and manage social tokens.
Niwa is the second official Dapp built on the Dev Protocol. It is specially made to be used by creators by letting them mint and manage social tokens. You can try a new type of organization instead of a conventional business corporation in order to realize creative projects.

On Niwa, YouTube market will be launched too.
This is our first time to support non OSS markets (Discord and YouTube).
We are thinking of supporting other non OSS markets on Niwa in the future (for example Twitter or Instagram).
Niwa would play a significant role in enlarging our creator economy.

**Why Discord?**

Many types of DAOs adopt Discord as one of their communication tools, and we firmly believe that Discord is one of the largest platforms where users demand its social tokenization. In 2022, there’s no doubt that we’ll see the acceleration and spreading of the creator economy concept, as well as the rise and need of social tokens. By launching the Discord Market, we can invite as many creators as possible and expand the Dev Protocol ecosystem. We consider Discord as the most efficacious market at the moment in order to grow the Dev Protocol ecosystem.

**Meaning of expanding markets**

While Dev Protocol is popular as a protocol supporting OSS (Open source software) creators, the show doesn’t end there. Having started the journey into the Youtube market recently, Dev Protocol has taken its first steps towards expanding the creator economy into areas beyond OSS. Thanks to the YouTube market, users can now realize the social tokenization of their YouTube channels, which unlocks a whole new market dynamic between YouTubers and their fans by making great use of social tokens.

The Discord market is being added as an update at this time, and we’re planning to add many more different markets such as Twitter, Instagram etc in the near future. The size of the creator economy is crucial to Dev Protocol because with the increase in the numbers of creators using it, the demand for DEV token is expected to increase as well, driving the value of DEV token to newer heights. Briefly speaking, the creator economy itself on Dev Protocol is the value of the Dev Protocol community. That’s why we’re aiming at expanding the market to see the further development of Dev Protocol. One of our final objectives is to create a world where any creator can use the powers of Dev Protocol to grow a community.

**Release and what lies ahead …**

The Discord market will be released as our new market at the end of this month. This expansion will lead to the extension of the Dev Protocol creator economy and the value refinement of the DEV token itself. We will continue to proactively expand our markets beyond OSS, further enhancing and cementing Dev Protocol as the leading name in the space of the Creator Economy market.
